# League of Legends REST API

This project is a RESTful API that utilizes the League of Legends API to retrieve game data. It is built using Node.js, NestJS, TypeORM, PostgreSQL, and TypeScript. The architecture follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern with additional components such as Services, Repositories and Entities.

**Note: The project is not meant to be used. It is an example project of a third party API integration**

## Features

1. **Recent Matches**:
   - Retrieves recent matches for a player with pagination options.
   - Provides detailed information about each match, including the champion used, win status, KDA (kills, deaths, assists), CS per minute, runes, assists, and spells.

2. **Player Summary**:
   - Fetches a summary of a player's statistics.
   - Displays the current rank with name and image.
   - Shows the player's current league points, wins, losses, KDA, average CS per minute, and average vision score.

3. **Leaderboards**:
   - Calculates the position of each player based on specific criteria.
   - The criteria include League Points and Win Rate.
   - Returns the current position of a player in the leaderboard.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the needed dependencies.
3. Configure the PostgreSQL database connection by providing the necessary credentials in the .env file. (there's a sample.env)
4. Configure your league of legends developer API key (https://developer.riotgames.com/)

Run the following command to start the application:
`npm run start`

The API endpoints can be accessed using a tool like Postman. You can import the provided Postman collection to test the available endpoints.

## Caching

The project incorporates request caching to improve performance and reduce the number of requests made to the League of Legends API. This caching mechanism helps minimize the response time for subsequent requests.

## API Endpoints

1. **POST /player/recentMatches**
   - Retrieves recent matches for a player with pagination support.
2. **POST /player/summary**
   - Fetches a summary of a player's statistics.
3. **POST /player/leaderboard**
   - Calculates the position of a player in the leaderboards based on League Points and Win Rate.
